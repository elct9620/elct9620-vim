This a vim configuration for myself.
I fork [eddie-vim](https://github.com/kaochenlong/eddie-vim)[eddie-vim] and use it several months.

But I still hope have a own vim configuration, so I reference [eddie-vim](https://github.com/kaochenlong/eddie-vim) settings, and create a my own version.
Now, it is very similar [eddie-vim](https://github.com/kaochenlong/eddie-vim) but I will try to customize it more for my coding work.
